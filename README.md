# I Used Rate of Change for 90 Days

This project documents a short trading experiment using the Rate of Change (ROC) indicator over a fixed 90 trading day period.

The goal of the experiment is observation, not optimisation. The strategy is applied exactly as defined, without tuning parameters or adding filters, to understand how ROC behaves in real market conditions.

## What this project explores

- How Rate of Change behaves over a short time window  
- How often ROC generates trades  
- How a simple ROC based approach compares to buy and hold  
- The shape of returns and drawdowns over 90 days  

---

## Key idea

Rate of Change measures price acceleration. In this project, it is used in its simplest form to isolate its strengths and limitations.

The focus is on behaviour, not performance.

---

## Results overview

Over the 90 day period:
- The strategy executed a limited number of trades  
- Performance differed from buy and hold  
- Drawdowns highlighted the risks of relying on momentum alone  

These results provide insight into when Rate of Change struggles and why additional structure may be necessary.

## Why this matters

Short experiments like this reveal details that long backtests often hide. They show how an indicator behaves day to day and how it reacts to changing market conditions.

Understanding these dynamics is a necessary step before building more complex systems.

## What comes next

This project serves as a foundation for further experiments, including:
- Testing Rate of Change across different markets  
- Extending the time window  
- Adding simple regime or risk controls  

Each extension builds on the same experimental framework.
